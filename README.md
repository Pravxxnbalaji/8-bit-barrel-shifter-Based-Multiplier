# ⚙️ 8-Bit Barrel Shifter Based Multiplier

## 🧩 Overview
A **barrel shifter–based multiplier** is a high-speed digital multiplier that utilizes a **barrel shifter** to perform rapid shift operations in a single clock cycle.  
Unlike traditional shift-and-add multipliers that require multiple clock cycles for each shift, the barrel shifter performs **parallel shifting**, leading to significant improvement in speed and efficiency.

This project focuses on the **design and FPGA implementation of an 8-bit barrel shifter–based multiplier** using **Verilog HDL**.

---

## 🔹 Introduction
Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation in digital systems and is widely used in:
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Control systems
- Image processing
- Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)

In hardware design, multipliers can be implemented using several techniques such as:
- Serial shift-and-add multiplication  
- Array (parallel) multiplication  
- Booth multiplication  
- Wallace tree multiplication  

While efficient, these traditional methods still require multiple clock cycles for bit shifting.  
To overcome this, the **barrel shifter** is introduced — a combinational circuit capable of performing all shifts **in one step**, resulting in **higher speed and lower latency**.

---

## 🔹 What is a Barrel Shifter?
A **barrel shifter** is a combinational circuit that can shift or rotate data by a specified number of bit positions **in a single clock cycle**.  
It is typically implemented using multiplexers to achieve simultaneous multi-bit shifting.

For an 8-bit input, the barrel shifter can shift data left or right by 0–7 bit positions based on control signals.

**Key Advantage:**  
Traditional shifters shift one bit per cycle, while a barrel shifter performs all shifts in parallel, enabling **instantaneous shift operations**.

---

## 🔹 Working Principle

Let the two 8-bit numbers be:

- **A (Multiplicand)** → 8 bits  
- **B (Multiplier)** → 8 bits  

### Step 1: Partial Product Generation
Each bit of the multiplier (B) is ANDed with all bits of the multiplicand (A), generating eight **partial products**.

\[
PP_i = A \text{ AND } B_i \quad \text{for } i = 0 \text{ to } 7
\]

### Step 2: Barrel Shifting
Each partial product is shifted left according to the bit position of the corresponding multiplier bit.  
The barrel shifter performs all shifts **in parallel**.

Example:
- If \( B_0 = 1 \): use \( A \times 2^0 \) (no shift)  
- If \( B_1 = 1 \): use \( A \times 2^1 \) (shift left by 1)  
- If \( B_2 = 1 \): use \( A \times 2^2 \) (shift left by 2), etc.

### Step 3: Addition of Partial Products
All the shifted partial products are then added using a network of adders (Ripple Carry or Carry-Save Adder).

\[
Product = \sum_{i=0}^{7} (PP_i \times 2^i)
\]

### Step 4: Final Output
The result is a **16-bit product** representing \( A \times B \).
